1. Purpose
Objective: Create a platform where users (students) can upload their projects. Once uploaded, the system automatically deploys the projects on a XAMPP server (localhost) and makes them accessible.
2. Key Features
A. User Dashboard
Upload Projects: A form to upload project files (ZIP or directory structure).
View Deployed Projects: List of projects with access URLs.
Status Updates: Indicate whether the project is deployed, queued, or failed.
B. Admin Dashboard
Monitor Projects: See all uploaded projects, deployment statuses, and error logs.
Manual Control: Options to restart, delete, or re-deploy specific projects.
User Management: (Optional) Add/remove users or view their upload history.
C. Automation
Deployment Pipeline:
Extract uploaded files to the appropriate folder in htdocs.
Configure project-specific settings like ports, databases, or .htaccess.
Restart XAMPP services if needed (Apache, MySQL).
Serve Projects: Generate URLs for access (e.g., http://localhost/<project_name>).
D. Notifications
Notify users about:
Successful deployment.
Errors during deployment.
Required configurations (e.g., database setup).
E. Access Management
Authentication:
User registration and login (optional for local use).
Role-based access for admins and students.
Public Access:
Determine if projects should be public or restricted to specific users.
3. Technological Stack
Backend:
PHP: For handling uploads, extraction, and XAMPP interaction.
MySQL: To store user data, project metadata, and logs.
Frontend:
Next.js: To build a modern, responsive dashboard.
Material UI: For a professional user interface.
File Management:
AJAX/Fetch API: For smooth upload and deployment status updates.
Automation:
Shell Commands: Execute commands to move files, restart services, and configure projects.
4. Deployment Workflow
File Upload:

User uploads a ZIP file or folder via the interface.
Backend validates and stores the file temporarily.
Project Setup:

Extract files to htdocs/<project_name>.
Configure settings (e.g., database, environment variables).
Test and Serve:

Restart necessary XAMPP services.
Verify project availability at http://localhost/<project_name>.
Feedback:

Notify users of the deployment status.
5. Potential Challenges
File Size Limitations: Configure PHP post_max_size and upload_max_filesize settings.
Security:
Sanitize uploads to prevent malicious scripts.
Use unique project directories to avoid conflicts.
XAMPP Service Management:
Automate service restarts without disrupting other running projects.
Database Setup:
Provide users with a script or tool to initialize their project databases.
